# Slim3Skeleton
A personal skeleton for Slimphp3.

I started this to use create a scaffold using my favourite libs, Eloquent, Monolog, Configula and Blade.
I'm currently not using this as my servers don't support PHP5 currently so it is incomplete.

# Design
This is meant to be as simple as possible with minimal dependencies so you can get up and running as quickly as possible.
Existing skeletons didn't meet my requirements, which is for one to get started without having to learn an entirely new Framework (I guess you would be using one if that's what you wanted).
Configuration is simple and services have been setup.


# Todo
Add a View render helper. Add monolog email handlers and bunch of other stuff.
Add Cartalyst Sentry
